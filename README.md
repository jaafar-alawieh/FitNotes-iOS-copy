### Heavily inspired by my desire to have the [FitNotes Android](https://www.fitnotesapp.com/) when I transitioned to iPhone. This Swift app is intended for personal use (for now).

# FitNotes-iOS

FitNotes is a fitness app designed specifically for gym, weight training, and resistance training enthusiasts. It provides a comprehensive set of features to help users track their workouts, customise exercises, and monitor progress.
